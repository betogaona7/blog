Why get up in the mornings? Why go to work? What is your reason to live?. Humans need a life purpose because otherwise, life will be meaningless. Mine is to cooperate in turning humanity into a multiplanetary life. That means to support the colonization of Mars. Humans on Earth, and humans on Mars.

This passion or ambition to do it was born when I started to see the National Geographic's TV show of [Mars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tIXHLC24aY). The serie shows how life would be on the red planet by combining fiction with real data. I fell in love with the whole concept, but it was until an episode which showed an interview with Elon Musk whom mentioned the idea of "multiplanetary life" that my spark of curiosity make boom! and I started to research about the topic. I found about SpaceX's private lunar mission which is to fly around the Moon like a "private tour" in 2033, the cargo mission to Mars in 2022, about the BFR (Big Fucking Rocket), and the concept of the earth to earth transportation, among other things. The more I learned, the more I got excited. The more I get excited, the more I investigate.

Surely, the idea may seem something far-fetched and far away of being achieved, but I really believe that SpaceX can achieve that within the next three decades. I want to participate in that, I mean, it will be the next major triumph of humanity, who don't want to be part of that. 

However, I am still trying to enter into the AI field, so SpaceX would not consider me to work for them yet because of my actual lack of professional experience, but I love challenges and also am a person of goals. Every decision we make lead us to somewhere, if we know where we want to be or where we want to go, then each decision reduces to a simple question: "does it bring me closer or away of that goal?". So, I will focus myself to get there, but meanwhile, I will create my own related projects to start putting my bit, in the end, a collaboration inside or outside a company is still a collaboration, and that is what makes big goals like A Multiplanetary Life come true.

Therefore, I will research the opportunity areas where I could apply AI to support the idea. Those could be about starship travels, starship launches, Mars environment, cargo missions, all where AI can be applied.  I want to use AI because it is what I love to do, it is my expertise area, so each Monday of the following three months will publish a reference post of where AI is being used or where I think it can be used. This as part of my creative process; Since the goal is so general, I need to divide it into smaller goals until I reach a unique and specific problem to solve. 

Goal: Develop an idea for the first related-project.
