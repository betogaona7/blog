			<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is not a real post, is a test… Writing a blog post, like all other writing, is a skill. To keep your reader interested, you should think about the structure of your copy and write appealing texts. You can help your readers to grasp the main idea of your post by providing headings, subheadings and clear paragraphs. If people understand and like your text, they are much more inclined to share, like, tweet and link to your post. And that will increase your rankings. So, in order to improve your ranking in Google, you should definitely try to maximize your writing skills!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some, writing for SEO purposes and writing to attract and captivate your audience could seem two contradictory goals. I totally disagree with this.ebioj Indeed, if you not only want a good but also an SEO-friendly blog post, the words you want to be found on should be in a very prominent place. But, using your keywords too often severely damages the readability of your text. So, you definitely shouldn’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I would like to give some tips on writing blog posts that are both very readable as well as SEO-friendly. I genuinely think those two goals should (and easily can!) go hand in hand.&lt;/p&gt;
