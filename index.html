<h1> Hi there! </h1>
<p> 
I'm Alberto, a systems computer engineer and AI engineer who wants to improve in something the world.
For that the only way I know is applying my knowledge, being a hand-on person. <br><br>

The concept of this blog is exactly that: take action executing ideas, develop project after project and in each one 
publish posts from the development of the idea, the research, experiments, problems that arise, the ways in which 
they are resolved and the decisions that I make until reach a final product, be it a prototype, a paper or simply learning how not to do things (lose to win).<br><br>

You can see this blog as a reference of how I develop and create things from scratch using deep learning or/and traditional AI, because that's what I love to do!<br><br>

Visualize and make it happen! that's the deal, and always remember:<br><br>
<em>
	Every morning you have two choices: continue to sleep with your dreams, or wake up and chase them.
