<p>Hey! I am Beto, an engineer who seeks to improve people's daily lives by developing artificial intelligence applications based on emotional motivators, so I am using this blog as a diary for each personal project that I am building from scratch. Hope you enjoy and find motivation in the process of each one. Feel free to question everything. </br></br></p>
