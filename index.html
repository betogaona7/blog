<h1> Alberto Gaona </h1>
<p>Hey there!, I am Beto, a systems computer engineer and AI engineer who wants to improve people lives, so I will combine my knowledge of creativity and technological innovation with my software development and deep learning skills to make it. You can see this blog as a reference of how to develop and create things from scratch using artificial intelligence because that is what I love to do!. </br></br></p>
